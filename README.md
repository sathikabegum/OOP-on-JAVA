  🚀 Project Concepts and Key Features:
  Leveraging the power of object-oriented programming (OOP), the Bike Rental System is structured around well-defined classes such as Bike, Customer, and Rental.
  This architectural choice enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

  💡 Educational Resource for OOP:
This project goes beyond functionality, serving as an educational tool to explore core concepts of object-oriented programming.
Concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are elegantly showcased in the context of a real-world bike rental scenario. 
Developers can delve into these concepts for a comprehensive understanding of OOP principles.

  🎉 Project Conclusion and Achievements:
  At the project's conclusion, we celebrate the successful implementation of a robust and user-friendly Bike Rental System using Java.
  The application of object-oriented principles, including encapsulation and information hiding, has resulted in a modular and maintainable codebase.
  Users can seamlessly interact with the system via a console-based menu, allowing for operations like bike rentals and returns.
